Hopefully will in the future add a way to create a virtual network card that emulates a promiscious mode wifi card using monitor mode and packet injection.

As of right now it can use XLink Kai to send packets captured by a WiFi card in monitor mode (802.11), in an Ethernet (802.3) format. 
No packets can be sent on the monitor WiFi card yet.
